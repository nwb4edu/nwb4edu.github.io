An interactive online textbook for teaching and learning neuroscience using Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) datasets.

**Live Website:** [https://nwb4edu.github.io](https://nwb4edu.github.io)

## About This Project

The `nwb4edu` online textbook provides interactive and self-guided resources for educators, students, and self-guided learners who would like to use open neuroscience datasets for research and/or teaching. The textbook introduces users to Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), a data standard for neurophysiology data, and teaches how to access, analyze, and visualize NWB datasets using Python.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Jupyter notebooks** with executable code
- **Comprehensive tutorials** covering data access, analysis, and visualization
- **Problem sets** for hands-on practice
- **Real datasets** from DANDI Archive and Allen Institute
- **Greatest Hits lessons** that recreate figures from landmark neuroscience papers
- **Launch on JupyterHub** - no local installation required

## Content Overview

The textbook is organized into several sections:

### Introduction
- Using this book
- Environment setup
- Resources for educators

### Data Science in Python (Refresher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

### PyNWB Lessons
**Lesson 1:** Introduction to NWB format
- Obtaining datasets with DANDI
- Working with NWB format in Python
- Interactive NWB data exploration

**Lesson 2:** Large-scale electrophysiology
- Spike sorting
- Visualizing extracellular recordings

### AllenSDK Lessons
**Lesson 3:** Single-cell electrophysiology
- Obtaining data for single cells
- Analyzing computed features

**Lesson 4:** Two-photon calcium imaging
- Retrieving Brain Observatory data
- Analyzing two-photon data
- Correlations in neural activity

### Greatest Hits in Neuroscience
Recreate figures from foundational papers:
- Place fields (O'Keefe & Dostrovsky, 1971; Grosmark & Buzsáki, 2016)
- Rotational dynamics in motor cortex (Churchland et al., 2012)

## Using This Textbook

### For Students

The easiest way to use this textbook is through the live website at [https://nwb4edu.github.io](https://nwb4edu.github.io). You can launch any notebook directly on JupyterHub using the rocket icon in the top right corner of each page. No installation on your computer is required when using JupyterHub!

### For Local Development

If you want to run the notebooks locally:

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nwb4edu/nwb4edu.github.io.git
cd nwb4edu.github.io
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### For Educators

This textbook is designed to be modular - you can use individual lessons or entire sections in your courses. All materials are licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0, so you're free to adapt and modify them for your teaching needs.

See our [For Educators](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Introduction/For_Educators.html) guide for more information on integrating these materials into your curriculum.

## Building the Book

This textbook is built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

### Requirements

Install the documentation build requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
```

### Build Process

To build the book locally:

```bash
jupyter-book build .
```

Or use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make build
```

To clean the build directory:

```bash
make clean
```

The built HTML files will be in `_build/html/`.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

The book is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `master` branch. To manually deploy:
