The Allen SDK requires Python 3.11 due to numpy version compatibility. All other lessons work with the default DandiHub environment.\n\n### Step 1: Open a Terminal\n- In JupyterHub, click \"File\" → \"New\" → \"Terminal\"\n\n### Step 2: Create the conda environment with pip\n```bash\nconda create --name nwb4edu python=3.11 pip -y\n```\n\n### Step 3: Activate the environment\n```bash\nconda activate nwb4edu\n```\n\n### Step 4: Install required packages\n```bash\nPIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=false pip install allensdk ipykernel\n```\n**Note:** This installation may take 5-10 minutes to complete. Please be patient while the packages are downloaded and installed.\n\n### Step 5: Create a Jupyter kernel for this environment\n```bash\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name nwb4edu --display-name \"Python 3.11 (nwb4edu)\"\n```\n\n### Step 6: Refresh your browser\n- Refresh the JupyterHub page to see the new kernel\n\n### Step 7: Select the kernel in Lesson 3 & 4 notebooks\n- Open a notebook from Lesson 3 or 4\n- Click \"Kernel\" → \"Change Kernel\" → \"Python 3.11 (nwb4edu)\"\n\n### Step 8: Verify the installation\nRun this in a notebook cell to verify everything installed correctly:\n```python\nimport sys\nprint(f\"Python version: {sys.version}\")\nimport allensdk\nprint(f\"allensdk version: {allensdk.__version__}\")\n```"
