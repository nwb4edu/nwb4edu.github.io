This process is called <b>spike sorting</b> (discussed in detail in a future lesson!). Although we can do spike sorting fairly automatically and be fairly confident that we've correctly identified different neurons, we can't know *with complete confidence*. So, researchers tend to call \"neurons\" in extracellular recordings \"units,\" reflecting that we *think* it's a separate neuron, but don't know for sure.
