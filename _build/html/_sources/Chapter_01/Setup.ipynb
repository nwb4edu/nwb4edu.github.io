    "As mentioned in \"how to use this book,\" you can run the code in this book on the DANDI Jupyter Hub (https://hub.dandiarchive.org/). **JupyterHub** is an online coding environment in which you can run code on a remote server. Usefully, the folks at DANDI have set up a JupyterHub so that you can easily access the tools and data. To do so, follow these directions:\n",
    "1. If you do not have already, set up a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup). It's free, and it's a great way to start tracking your code!\n",
    "2. Go to the Dandihub at [https://hub.dandiarchive.org/](https://hub.dandiarchive.org/) and log in using your GitHub account.\n",
    "3. Choose \"Base\" as your server option.\n",
    "4. Open a Terminal.\n",
    "5. Type `git clone https://github.com/nwb4edu/nwb4edu-dandi` and enter.\n",
    "6. Look for the new `nwb4edu-dandi` folder on the left side list of folders.\n",

If you have an old version of DANDI, it will prompt you to install a newer version. Type \"Y\" if you would like to install a new version (this is recommended). If you don't have DANDI at all, it will install the most recent version."
