    "In this notebook, we've looked closely at just 100 seconds of one channel in a 384-channel recording. You can imagine how long spike sorting would take if we needed to do this for *all* of the data. Thankfully, there are more automated spikesorting tools which enable researchers to automatically sort their data, with just a little bit of sorting by hand. In the next notebook, we'll work with data that has already been sorted for us. The resulting data simply has spike times for each sorted neuron (or \"unit\") -- the moments in the experiment where a spike happened. This is the most common format for data sharing of extracellularly recorded data, since it's much more concise, and the hard work of spike sorting has already happened."
