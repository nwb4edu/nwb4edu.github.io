# # Lesson #4: Two Photon Imaging
# 
# Two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful way to simultaneously image hundreds or even thousands of cells simultaneously. The [Allen Brain Observatory](https://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/brain_observatory.html) contains two-photon imaging data grouped together by mouse cre line, brain structure, and imaging depth.
# 
# In this lesson, you'll work directly with this data through the AllenSDK.
# 
# For an example of what this type of data looks like in action, run the cell below.
