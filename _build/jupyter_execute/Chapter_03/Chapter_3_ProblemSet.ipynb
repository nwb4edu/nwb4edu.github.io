    "1. In [Chapter 3.1](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Chapter_03/Obtaining_Datasets_with_DANDI.html), we demonstrated how to download a particular DANDIset. Modify this code to download [this dataset](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000130/draft), and use the additional code you encountered in 3.2 to answer the following questions:\n",
    "    - What publication is this dataset affiliated with? Include the title, journal, and authors.\n",
    "    - In 2-3 sentences, summarize the main approaches and goals of this paper.\n",
    "    - Describe two columns of data in `intervals`. What information do these columns provide?\n",
    "    - How many units (putative neurons) are in this dataset?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. In [Chapter 3.2](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Chapter_03/Working_with_NWB_format_in_Python.html) we demonstrated how to create a dataframe with all of the units (possible neurons) that were recorded. How would you filter this dataframe for only \"Fair\" units? Provide a code snippet for your answer.\n",
