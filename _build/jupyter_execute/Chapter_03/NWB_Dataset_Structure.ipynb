    "# The Structure of NWB Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "NWB datasets can be found in a few different places. Throughout this online textbook, we'll introduce two primary ways to obtain NWB datasets: through DANDI and through the Allen Institute SDK (Chapter X). In this chapter, we'll show you how to download a sample dataset via DANDI.\n",

    "**Learning objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "* Explain the three common features of datasets: metadata, raw data, and processed data\n",
    "* Identify and implement multiple ways to [obtain a NWB dataset via DANDI](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Chapter_03/Obtaining_Datasets_with_DANDI.html)\n",
    "* [Explore the metadata contained in a typical Dandiset](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Chapter_03/Working_with_NWB_format_in_Python.html)\n",
    "* [Use an interactive widget for a big picture view of a Dandiset](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Chapter_03/Interactive_NWB_Data_Exploration.html)\n",

    "In this chapter, we'll dig into one of the datasets that uses a technology known as Neuropixels to simultaneously record from many neurons. First, let's get the dataset."
