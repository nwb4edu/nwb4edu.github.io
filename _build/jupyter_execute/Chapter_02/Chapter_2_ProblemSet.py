# ## Chapter 2 Problem Set
# 
# 1. In [Chapter 2.1](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Chapter_02/Obtaining_Datasets_with_DANDI.html), we demonstrated how to download a particular DANDIset. Modify this code to download [this dataset](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000130/draft), and use the additional code you encountered in 2.2 to answer the following questions:
#     - What publication is this dataset affiliated with? Include the title, journal, and authors.
#     - In 2-3 sentences, summarize the main approaches and goals of this paper.
#     - Describe two columns of data in `intervals`. What information do these columns provide?
#     - How many units (putative neurons) are in this dataset?
#     
#     
# 2. In [Chapter 2.2](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Chapter_02/Working_with_NWB_format_in_Python.html) we demonstrated how to create a dataframe with all of the units (possible neurons) that were recorded. How would you filter this dataframe for only "Fair" units? Provide a code snippet for your answer.
