# # Lesson 3 Problem Set
# 
# In this lesson, we compared spiny cells to aspiny cells. However, the Allen Institute data has many more comparisons we could make!
# 
# For this problem set, it's up to you to choose which cell types to compare.
# 
# * If you'd like to compare cells from different species, the column name is `species`.
# * If you'd like to compare two transgenic lines (mouse cells only), the column name is `transgenic_line`.
# * For different layers of cortex, use `structure_layer_name`.
# 
# You'll also decide which pre-computed feature to compare between these cell types.
# 
# Choose your comparison and pre-computed feature, and generate a visualization to show whether or not those two cell types are similar or different for your feature. You may also want to generate a plot of the recording trace, for example, to demonstrate a difference in spike waveform.
