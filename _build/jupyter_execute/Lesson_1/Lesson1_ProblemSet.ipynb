    "\n",
    "1. In the first notebook, we demonstrated how to download a particular DANDIset. Modify this code to download [this dataset](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000130/draft), and use the additional code you encountered in the following notebook to answer the following questions:\n",
    "    - What publication is this dataset affiliated with? Include the title, journal, and authors.\n",
    "    - In 2-3 sentences, summarize the main approaches and goals of this paper.\n",
    "    - Describe two columns of data in `intervals`. What information do these columns provide?\n",
    "    - How many units (putative neurons) are in this dataset?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. In \"Working with NWB in Python\" we demonstrated how to create a dataframe with all of the units (possible neurons) that were recorded. How would you filter this dataframe for only \"Fair\" units? ([Here's a reminder](https://nwb4edu.github.io/Data_Science_In_Python/Pandas.html#subsetting) on how to subset a dataframe!) Provide a code snippet for your answer."
